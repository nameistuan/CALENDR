# 📅 Calendr

**Calendr** is a modern, lightweight, and **power-user friendly** calendar app.  
Motivated to create a better version of Google Calendar — reimagined to be **faster**, **simpler**, and more **focused** for everyday use.

## 🌟 Why Calendr?

Most calendar apps (including Google Calendar) are powerful, but they can feel **clunky** and **overloaded**.  
Calendr is designed to be the **calendar you actually want to use daily**:

✅ **Quick & intuitive editing** – Add or change events with just a click or shortcut.  
✅ **Minimal & distraction-free design** – Focus on your schedule, not menus.  
✅ **Built for speed** – Lightweight desktop app that opens instantly.  
✅ **Local-first privacy** – Your events are stored **on your device** by default.

## 🎯 The Goal

Calendr isn’t just another calendar — it’s a **better way to organize your life**.  

We want to make an app that:
- **Feels effortless** to use (inline edits, drag & drop, powerful shortcuts)
- **Keeps you productive** with features like smarter reminders and focus mode
- Starts **local-first**, but is built to expand to **sync and collaboration** in the future

---

## 🚀 Planned Features (MVP)

🔹 Month, Week, and Day views  
🔹 Add, edit, delete events quickly  
🔹 Simple reminders (local notifications)  
🔹 Keyboard shortcuts for power users  
🔹 Clean, Tailwind-powered UI

## 🌈 Future Ideas

✨ **Natural language input** (“Dinner with Alex next Friday at 7 PM”)  
✨ **Recurring event templates** (like a “Workout routine” you can drop on your week)  
✨ **Optional sync** (cloud or self-hosted, your choice)  
✨ **AI suggestions** for scheduling & reminders  
✨ **Collaboration features** (shared calendars, invites)
